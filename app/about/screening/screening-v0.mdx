## Screening process

The CDRXIV screening process is not peer review and it does not assess the quality of the research presented. Instead, the screening process checks for four basic requirements:

1. The submission does not violate personal privacy or present a potential harm.
2. The submission follows a clear and logical structure.
3. The submission is not plagiarized.
4. The submission falls within CDRXIVâ€™s scope and presents new research results.

Having clear and logical structure (Requirement 2) means different things for article and data submissions. For articles, it means submitting a preprint that contains the elements of a standard scientific article (e.g., Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion). For datasets, it means that the data must be interpretable and usable based on the information in the abstract and the format of the data (e.g. clearly labeled headers, units, etc.).

If the submission is accepted, a DOI will be minted and the content will be posted on CDRXIV. If it is a data submission, the dataset will also be deposited in the CDRXIV Zenodo community.

Revisions can be made to article or data submissions at any time. A revised submission only undergoes the general screening step. Upon acceptance, a new version DOI is minted and the updated version is posted. Older versions will still be accessible on CDRXIV and from the original DOI.
