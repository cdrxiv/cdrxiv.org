## Screening process

The CDRXIV screening process involves two steps — a general screening step and an expert screening step. The screening process is not peer review and it does not assess the quality of the research. Instead, the screening process checks for three basic requirements:

1. The submission does not violate personal privacy or present a potential harm (general screening)
2. The submission follows a clear and logical structure (general screening)
3. The submission is within scope and presents new results (general and expert screening)

The second requirement — that the formatting is easy to follow — means different things for article and data submissions. For articles, it means that some variant of the standard structure is present (e.g., Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion). For datasets, it means that the data can be understood with the information submitted (it includes units, clearly labeled headers, etc.).

Our screening process is illustrated in the flowchart above. Upon first submission, the content undergoes general screening to evaluate requirements 1 and 2. Assuming it passes this evaluation, the submission progresses to a plagiarism check and is forwarded to a CDRXIV expert affiliate whose background aligns with the content’s subject matter. The affiliate screener evaluates the content for requirement 3 and sends their evaluation back to the editor for a final decision.

If the content is accepted, a DOI will be minted and the content will be posted on CDRXIV. If it is a data submission, the dataset will also be deposited in the CDRXIV Zenodo community.

Revisions can be made to articles or data submissions at any time. A revised submission only undergoes the general screening step. Upon acceptance, a new version DOI is minted and the updated version is posted. Older versions will still be accessible on CDRXIV and from the original DOI.
