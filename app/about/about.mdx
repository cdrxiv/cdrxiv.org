## Preprints and Data for Carbon Dioxide Removal

CDRXIV (pronounced “see-dee archive”) is a repository for preprint articles and datasets. It is free to submit content and free to use.

There are many approaches to CDR and even more scientific disciplines engaged in its research. Still, distinct CDR approaches share common ground around things like measurement, governance, and public support. Our goal is to provide a central hub for this cross-disciplinary learning to happen.

CDRXIV accepts preprint articles and datasets that present new results in any CDR topic generally. For more details about the kinds of submissions we accept, see our CDRXIV Scope page.
