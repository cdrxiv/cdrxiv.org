## Preprints and Data for Carbon Dioxide Removal

CDRXIV (pronounced “see-dee archive”) is a repository for preprint articles and datasets on carbon dioxide removal (CDR). It is free to submit content and free to use.

There are many ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and even more scientific disciplines engaged in researching them. Despite this breadth, distinct CDR approaches share common ground on things like measurement, governance, and public support. CDRXIV exists to speed up the process of knowledge sharing and provide a central hub for cross-disciplinary learning about CDR to happen.

CDRXIV accepts preprint articles and datasets that present new results on any CDR topic. Articles and data are not peer-reviewed or edited before being posted on CDRXIV. All submissions do undergo a basic screening process to ensure they pertain to CDR, provide required metadata, are not plagiarized, and do not contain offensive or private content. When CDRXIV posts a preprint or data submission online, this does not constitute an endorsement of the submission’s methods, assumptions, conclusions, or scientific quality.
