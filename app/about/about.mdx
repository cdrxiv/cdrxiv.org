CDRXIV (pronounced “see-dee archive”) is a repository for preprint articles and datasets on carbon dioxide removal (CDR). It is free to submit content and free to use.

There are many ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and even more scientific disciplines engaged in researching them. Despite this breadth, distinct CDR approaches share common scientific and practical challenges. CDRXIV exists to speed up the process of knowledge sharing and provide a central hub for cross-disciplinary learning about CDR.

CDRXIV accepts preprint articles and datasets that present new results on any CDR topic. Submissions are not peer-reviewed or edited before being posted on CDRXIV. Instead, they undergo a basic screening step to check that the submission pertains to CDR, is not plagiarized, and does not contain harmful content. The screening step does not evaluate the scientific merit or conclusions of any submission. For more details about the kinds of submissions we accept, see the [CDRXIV Scope](/about/scope) page.

The CDRXIV brand and website was designed by [The Office of Ordinary Things](https://ot.studio/). CDRXIV is built on [Janeway](https://janeway.systems/), and the code powering our website is [available on Github](https://github.com/cdrxiv) under MIT license.
