CDRXIV is a home for new research results and data on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). Preprints or data submissions must present new research results on human-driven techniques to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or directly related topics such as CDR quantification, modeling, or policy.

We are open to preprints and data on a wide variety of CDR approaches, both established and emerging, but especially encourage submissions on approaches that can ensure durable removal and long-term temperature stabilization.

Each submission to CDRXIV should represent a new research result that has not been published elsewhere. Preprint articles or data submissions with an abstract are both welcome.

CDRXIV does not accept:
- Review articles
- Book reviews
- White papers
- Editorials and opinion pieces
- Research proposals
- Posters, slides, or presentations

If you are not sure whether your work is within CDRXIVâ€™s scope, reach out to [support@cdrxiv.org](mailto:support@cdrxiv.org).
