CDRXIV is a home for new research results and data on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). Preprints or data submissions must present new research results on human-driven techniques to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or directly related topics such as CDR quantification, modeling, or policy.

We are open to preprints and data on a wide variety of CDR approaches, both established and emerging, but especially encourage submissions on approaches that can ensure durable removal and long-term temperature stabilization.

Each submission to CDRXIV should represent a new research result that has not been published elsewhere. Preprint articles or data submissions with an abstract are both welcome.

CDRXIV does not accept:

- Review articles
- Book reviews
- Editorials and opinion pieces
- Research proposals
- Posters, slides, or presentations

If you are not sure whether your work is within CDRXIV’s scope, reach out to [support@cdrxiv.org](mailto:support@cdrxiv.org).

## Topics

We use topics to sort content on the landing page and make it easier to search. Authors can select one or more topics across three dimensions:

### 1. **Type**: What kind of carbon removal is addressed?

- Biological CDR (e.g., biomass carbon removal and storage)
- Geochemical CDR (e.g., enhanced rock weathering)
- Synthetic CDR (e.g., direct air capture, direct ocean removal)

### 2. **Focus**: What part of the carbon removal system is the submission about?

- Removal process (e.g., CO₂ capture mechanisms, weathering rates)
- Storage process (e.g., geologic injection, storage durability)
- Supporting infrastructure (e.g., material inputs, transportation networks, sensors)
- Environmental impacts (e.g., ecological response, water quality effects)
- Socioeconomic impacts (e.g., labor implications, cost effectiveness)
- Policy and regulation (e.g., permitting, regulation, incentives)

### 3. **Method**: What research methods were used?

- Accounting (e.g., life cycle assessments)
- Experiments and field trials (e.g., lab, mesocosm, or field studies)
- Modeling (e.g., techno-economic, physical, or economic modeling)
- Qualitative research (e.g., interviews, participant observation, document analysis)

These topics are meant to be general descriptors of the submission. We encourage authors to add custom keywords to their submissions to further describe their work.
