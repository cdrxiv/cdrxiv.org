CDRXIV is a home for new research results and data on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR). The scope is human-driven techniques to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, along with directly related topics such as CDR quantification, modeling, policy, projections, and more. We are open to preprints on a wide variety of CDR approaches, both established and emerging, but especially encourage submissions on approaches that can ensure durable removal and long-term temperature stabilization.

Each submission to CDRXIV should represent a new research result. Preprint articles or data submissions with a brief explainer are both welcome. CDRXIV does not accept submissions that have already been published elsewhere.

CDRXIV does not accept:

- Review articles
- Book reviews
- White papers
- Editorials and opinion pieces
- Research proposals
- Poster, slides, or presentations
