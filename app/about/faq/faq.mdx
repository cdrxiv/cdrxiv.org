### <a id="submit-without-preprint"></a>Can I submit a dataset without a related preprint article?

Yes. CDRXIV accepts data submissions even if they are not tied to a preprint article. These data-only submissions still require an abstract, which functions as a brief description of what the data files contain. See our screening process for more information on data-only expectations.

### <a id="max-file-size"></a>What is the maximum file size I can submit?

Article files must be less than 1 GB, data files must be less than 10 GB?

### <a id="posting-time"></a>How long does it take for my submission to be publicly posted?

Our screening and approval process is usually complete in 1-4 business days. We will notify you if it will take longer for any reason.
