We appreciate your interest in CDRXIV, a preprint and data sharing service offered by CarbonPlan (“CarbonPlan,” we, our, or us). At CarbonPlan, we respect your concerns about privacy and value the relationship that we have with you. This Cookies Notice (the “**Notice**”) explains how we use cookies and other similar technology to recognize you when you use the CDRXIV Services (as defined in our Terms of Use) (the “**Services**”). This Notice does not apply to other CarbonPlan sites or services unless otherwise noted on that site or service. This Cookie Notice explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are text files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website and store certain information about your usage of the Services. They are useful because they allow websites to recognize a user’s device. They are then returned to the original website on each subsequent visit or to any other website that recognizes them. For more information on cookies, go to [https://knowcookies.com](https://knowcookies.com/).

The term “**cookie**” is used in this Notice in the broad sense to include all similar techniques and technology, including web beacons and log files.

**Type of cookies we use, information collected and reasons for collection**

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are strictly necessary for technical reasons for our Services to operate and/or provide basic functionality to you, such as authentication, and we refer to these as “essential” cookies. Although CDRXIV limits its use of cookies to essential cookies, our third-party service providers may use essential cookies, functional cookies (which may remember user preferences, such as language or screen size), or analytics cookies (which may collect site or email statistics, such as in our email newsletter).

Cookies may be temporary in nature, for example they may last only until you close your web browser, or they may be more permanent, lasting days or even years. CDRXIV does not use permanent cookies. Our third-party service providers may set temporary or permanent cookies to store site customization and/or analytics information.

**First-party cookies: **

These are temporary essential cookies are created by CarbonPlan. They are used to authenticate you and for site security. For example, we set the following cookies: \_\_Secure-next-auth.session-token  (standard session token); \_\_Secure-next-auth.callback-url  (stores where the app should redirect to after Janeway login); and \_\_Host-next-auth.csrf-token  (extra security token to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery).

**Third-party cookies: **

In addition to our first-party cookies, some third-party companies may place and access cookies (including web beacons) on your computer. These cookies, which include essential, functional and analytical cookies, enable third-party features or functionalities to be provided on or through the Services.

By way of example, some specific third-party cookies that may be set in connection with the Services are:

- Janeway sets two essential temporary cookies, for authentication purposes: JANEWAYSESSID and csrftoken.

- Our analytics provider, Plausible, does not use cookies. See [https://plausible.io/data-policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy).  

- Our Captcha provider, hCaptcha (which we use for fraud prevention and to ensure users are human), sets essential cookies that are strictly necessary for provision of the service, including preference cookies, session cookies, and load balancing cookies, and statistical cookies managed by hCaptcha that are not used for profiling. You can read more about how hCaptcha uses cookies here: https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy.
- If you subscribe to CDRXIV’s newsletter, then Mailchimp will place single pixel gifs, also known as web beacons, in each newsletter email. These contain unique identifiers that enable Mailchimp and CDRXIV to recognize when recipients have opened an email or clicked certain links. These technologies record each Contact’s email address, IP address, date, and time associated with each open and click for a campaign. More information about the cookies used in Mailchimp-powered newsletter emails can be found here: https://mailchimp.com/legal/cookies/.
- Zenodo does not use cookies when you view data on CDRXIV. However, if you view data directly from within the Zenodo community, then Zenodo will set essential, functional and analytic cookies, as described in their cookie policy: [https://about.zenodo.org/cookie-policy/](https://about.zenodo.org/cookie-policy/).

- If you view content from our Github page, then Github will set essential, functional and analytic cookies while you use their site, as described in their cookie policy: https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement

- If you create an account with us, submit content or review submissions to CDRXIV, the emails you may receive in response may be sent by Janeway. Janeway uses Mailgun for these system messages, which may include cookies that enable Mailgun to recognize when recipients have opened an email or clicked certain links. More information about Mailgun’s cookie practices can be found here: https://www.mailgun.com/legal/cookie-policy/.

When you access third party sites that may direct you to CDRXIV, or when you are reading integration or social media links, cookies can be created by the companies disseminating these links. These third parties are responsible for the cookies they install and it is their cookie policies which apply. For more information, you are advised to check the cookie policy directly on these third party sites with regard to their use of cookies.

** Cookie management**

** All cookies:**

You can exercise your preference to receive all types of cookies by managing cookies from your web browser. As the means by which to activate or deactivate cookies varies from one web browser to another, you should visit your web browser’s help menu for more information on cookie preferences.
