Please note that this policy does **not** apply to CarbonPlan’s website or other CarbonPlan projects. For CarbonPlan’s terms of use, please see https://carbonplan.org/terms.

_Additional terms_: In addition to the CDRXIV Terms, your use of any Services may also be subject to specific terms applicable to a particular Service, including terms applicable to Services powered by our third-party service providers (“Additional Terms”). Our Privacy Policy, available at [https://cdrxiv.org/privacy-policy](https://cdrxiv.org/privacy-policy), is one of the Additional Terms that applies to the Services, and it is hereby expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms. If there is any conflict between the Additional Terms and the CDRXIV Terms, then the Additional Terms apply in relation to the relevant Service.

_Collectively, the Terms_: The CDRXIV Terms, together with any Additional Terms (including our Privacy Policy), form a binding legal agreement between you and CarbonPlan in relation to your use of the Services. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to herein as the “Terms.”

If we feel the modifications are material, we will make reasonable efforts to post a prominent notice on the relevant Website(s) and/or notify you via email if you have a current account. All new and/or revised Terms take effect immediately and apply to your use of the Services from that date on. Your continued use of any Services after new and/or revised Terms are effective indicates that you have read, understood, and agreed to those Terms.

Under no circumstances is CarbonPlan liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to: any infringing Content, any errors or omissions in Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, transmitted, linked from, or otherwise accessible through or made available via the Services.

_Licensing of Third Party Content:_ We may link to or publish content, information, tools, data, and/or software on our Websites that belong to or originate from third parties (the “Third Party Content”). We may indicate on the Websites which licensing terms we believe apply to such Third Party Content, but we cannot guarantee that such indications are accurate. You agree to independently verify the terms of the license and other copyright and attribution information associated with any Third Party Content you intend to use. You agree that you are solely responsible for your use of Third Party Content made available through the Services, including independently verifying the license that applies to such Third Party Content, and complying with such license, including by providing proper attribution when required. You should review the terms of the applicable license before you use any Third Party Content so that you know what you can and cannot do.

**5\. Content Supplied by You**

_You retain ownership of Your Content_. As between you and CarbonPlan, you remain the owner of all Content that you post, submit, or otherwise share with, on or through the Services (“Your Content”), subject to the licenses set forth herein, and any other licenses you may have applied to Your Content.

_Your responsibilities and warranties_: You represent, warrant, and agree that: (i) none of Your Content violates or infringes upon the rights of any third party, including without limitation copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, or other personal or proprietary rights; breaches or conflicts with any obligation, such as a confidentiality obligation; or contains libelous, defamatory, or otherwise unlawful material; (ii) you have all rights necessary to grant the licenses specified herein, and you will prominently and accurately mark Your Content with licensing and other applicable permission status and attribution information; (iii) you are either the sole author of Your Content, or each of the authors and owners of Your Content, have fully authorized you to enter into these Terms and to submit and license Your Content to us; (iv) all information you provide during the submission process or otherwise in connection with Your Content is complete and accurate; (v) Your Content contains nothing that breaches a duty of confidentiality or discloses any private or personal information of any person without that person’s consent; (vi) all data concerning human subjects is securely de-identified; (vii) all statements contained in Your Content are true and correct; (viii) all research involving humans or animals conforms to ethical guidelines and has been approved by the relevant ethics committee(s) and/or institutional review board(s); (ix) you have submitted true and accurate conflict of interest statements, including a description of relevant funding grants; (x) all information provided about your and any other person’s identity, qualifications, and academic or business positions/affiliations is complete and accurate; and (xi) you are solely responsible for Your Content.

_Licensing Your Content to Us_: If you contribute Your Content (which includes, without limitation, any software, article, post, code, content, data, suggestion, feedback, or any other information) to CDRXIV, including through the Services, you will and hereby do, grant us a worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable license to copy, modify, distribute, publicly display and publicly perform Your Content \- and to use the name, likeness, photograph, ORCID, publication history, institutional affiliation, and biographical information of you and all authors of Your Content \- in all forms of media for the purpose of providing and marketing the Services, including without limitation analyzing Your Content, making production, archival and backup copies, improving the Services over time, and sharing Your Content with other users and the public through our own media and websites, through our services that are hosted and/or powered by third parties (for example, Janeway ([https://janeway.systems](https://janeway.systems)), which hosts articles; Zenodo ([https://zenodo.org/](https://zenodo.org/)), which hosts data; and our Github ([https://github.com](https://github.com)) repository), and through third-party services, such as social media.

_Licensing Your Content to Other Users:_ If you submit Your Content to the Services and CarbonPlan enables you to publish or share Your Content through the Services, you grant to all users of the Services (including our volunteer reviewers) a worldwide, nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to view, display, and comment on (privately or publicly) Your Content, and to make a small number of copies of Your Content as needed to facilitate such viewing, display and commentary, but such license does not give such other users the right to sell, reuse, remix, adapt, or publicly distribute Your Content, except as supported by the functionality of the Services. For clarity, nothing in these Terms is intended to limit or narrow any right that users may have to use Your Content consistent with copyright exceptions and limitations, such as the fair use doctrine. If you contribute Your Content to any portion of the Services that requires you to, or in which you elect to, grant a specific additional license to other users, such as a public (e.g., open source) license, you will and hereby do grant that license to us, to the public, and to the other users of the Services. By way of example, when you submit an article and/or data to the Services, you may be offered the opportunity to apply one or more public licenses (such as CC-BY, the MIT License, etc.) to it. If you do so, then all users, and the public generally, may use your submission under the license you have applied.

_Posting, Removal_: CarbonPlan may, but is not obligated to, permit you to publish or share Your Content on the Services. CarbonPlan may, but is not obligated to, review Your Content and may delete or remove Your Content, without notice, from any of the Services in its sole discretion. Removal of any of Your Content from the Services (by you or CarbonPlan) does not revoke any of the licenses you have granted herein.
